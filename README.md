This project utilizes Logistic Regression to predict whether a person has a diseased heart or a normal heart. It takes into account various factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to provide an accurate assessment of heart health, aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.
